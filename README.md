## Background

This is a side project to implement popular shortest path algorithms. While other projects implemented a user defined maze, I developed a randomized maze generation to create mazes to test the algorithm.

## Install

First install the necessary python libraries that the project utilizes.

```pip install requirements.txt```

For Macs install ghostscript to allow 

```brew install ghostscript```

## Usage

```python main.py```


## Future Implementations

 - Implement a drawing GUI to allow users to draw their own mazes or utilize a randomized maze.
